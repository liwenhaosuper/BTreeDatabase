README
	This document.

btree.py
	The Btree code. It hard codes the data file name 
	and takes as input the a set of commands separated by TAB.
	It searches each one using equality search, i.e. assuming
	all of [a,b,c,d] are filled in with real values.

	Note: a function to print all the contents of an index is given
	but not practical for the full data set. You can use testdata.txt
	to print and test code.

scores_byname.txt
	The input file to index. Scores of contestants. Someone
	matched the names to give you full names. 

scores_inputsample.txt
	A sample input file to search. Use this for testing your code.

testdata.txt
	A small test data file. You can print this data to see if your
	code is actually working.
